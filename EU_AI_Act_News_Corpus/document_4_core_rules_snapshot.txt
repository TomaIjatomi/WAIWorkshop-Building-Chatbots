## Regulation Structure & Scope  
The **EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation 2024/1689)** sets harmonized rules across member states. It covers AI systems across sectors, except military and research exemptions.

### Risk-Based Approach  
- **Prohibited Practices**: manipulation, subliminal techniques, biometric social scoring  
- **Minimal Risk AI**: basic transparency rules  
- **High-Risk AI**: used in critical areas (healthcare, finance, employment, law enforcement)

### Obligations for High-Risk Systems  
High-risk systems must meet obligations: conformity assessment, documentation, human oversight, accuracy, and post-market monitoring.

### Timeline & Enforcement  
Prohibitions apply immediately; high-risk system rules take effect by **August 2027**. The **AI Office** oversees general-purpose AI systems, ensuring compliance.

### Key Highlights  
The AI Act establishes a global benchmark for AI regulation, balancing innovation and ethical use across Europe.
