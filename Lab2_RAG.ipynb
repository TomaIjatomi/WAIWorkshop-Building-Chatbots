Here are several exciting concepts and techniques you can explore to make your RAG systems even more powerful and intelligent.\n","\n","1. Optimize the Core Pipeline\n","Before moving to complex architectures, you can significantly improve the performance of the basic RAG flow:\n","\n","    * Smarter Chunking: Instead of splitting by a fixed character count, try Semantic Chunking. This method splits text based on semantic similarity, keeping related ideas together in the same chunk, which can greatly improve context.\n","\n","    * Hybrid Search: Combine vector search (semantic) with traditional keyword search (like BM25). This is powerful for queries that depend on specific keywords or acronyms.\n","\n","    * Re-ranking: Use a two-stage process. First, retrieve a larger number of documents (e.g., 20). Then, use a more powerful, slower model (a cross-encoder) to re-rank the initial results and select the top few (e.g., 3-5) to send to the LLM.\n","\n","\n","2. Agentic RAG\n","This is the cutting edge. In a simple RAG chain, the process is static. In Agentic RAG,  you use an LLM-powered agent that can think, reason, and use tools. The agent can make decisions in a loop:\n","\n","    * Analyze the Query: The agent first looks at the user's question and decides on a plan.\n","\n","    * Decide to Retrieve (or Not): It might decide that the question is simple and doesn't require retrieval at all.\n","\n","    * Perform Complex Searches.\n","\n","    * Reflect and Refine: The agent can look at the search results and decide they aren't good enough, then reformulate the query and search again.\n","\n","Further Reading\n","* [Langchain Docts - Retrieval](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/retrieval/)\n","* [DeepLearning.AI - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"QQfR98ZeIwH6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
